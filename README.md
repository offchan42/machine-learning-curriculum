# Machine Learning Curriculum

Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence dedicated at making
machines learn from observational data without being explicitly programmed.

> Machine learning and AI are not the same. Machine learning is an instrument in
> the AI symphony — a component of AI. So what is Machine Learning — or ML —
> exactly? It’s the ability for an algorithm to learn from prior data in order
> to produce a behavior. ML is teaching machines to make decisions in situations
> they have never seen.

## Machine Learning in General

Study this section to understand fundamental concepts and develop intuitions before going any deeper.

> A computer program is said to learn from experience `E` with respect to some
> class of tasks `T` and performance measure `P` if its performance at tasks in
> `T`, as measured by `P`, improves with experience `E`.

reward is the goal of reinforcement learning.

## Deep Learning

Deep learning is a branch of machine learning where deep artificial neural
networks (DNN) — algorithms inspired by the way neurons work in the brain — find
patterns in raw data by combining multiple layers of artificial neurons. As the
layers increase, so does the neural network’s ability to learn increasingly
abstract concepts.

The simplest kind of DNN is
a [Multilayer Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron)
(MLP).

### Convolutional Neural Networks

DNNs that work with grid data like sound waveforms, images and videos better
than ordinary DNNs. They are based on the assumptions that nearby input units
are more related than the distant units. They also utilize translation
invariance. For example, given an image, it might be useful to detect the same
kind of edges everywhere on the image.
They are sometimes called **convnets** or **CNNs**.

  most articles only talk about convolution in grayscale image, but he describe
  convolution in images with color channels as well. He also talks about the
  concerns and the assumptions that convnets make. This is a great lecture!

DNNs that have states. They also understand sequences that vary in length.
They are sometimes called **RNNs**.

## I am confused, too many links, where do I start?
If you are a beginner and want to get started with my suggestions, please read this issue:
[https://github.com/off99555/machine-learning-curriculum/issues/4](https://github.com/off99555/machine-learning-curriculum/issues/4)

## Disclaimer

This is a really big list because I also point to other people's list to ensure
that most of the resources are accessible from this page without you looking
anywhere else.

Most of these resources are the ones I enjoy reading/watching. I wouldn't put
something that I am not interested in here.

**NOTE**: There is no particular rank for each link. The order in which they
appear does not convey any meaning and should not be treated differently.

## How to contribute to this list
1. Fork this [repository](https://github.com/off99555/machine-learning-curriculum), then apply your change.
2. Make a [pull request](https://github.com/off99555/machine-learning-curriculum/pull/new/master) and tag me if you want.
3. That's it. If your edition is useful, I'll merge it.

Or you can just submit a [new issue](https://github.com/off99555/machine-learning-curriculum/issues/new)
containing the resource you want me to include if you don't have time to send a pull request.

The resource you want to include should be free to study.
